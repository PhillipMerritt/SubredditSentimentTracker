That's way too late. By 1929 while it still isn't the case that The Nazis were inevitable I think it's fair to say the fall of the democracy was, and it was likely going to fall into some sort of dictatorship.  \n\nTo really get a solid picture you probably need to start with the revolutions of 1848, but more reasonably with Otto von Bismarck coming to power in 1862. So much of the Nazi appeal was based on the Bismark era, and his Second Reich. This was the 'Great' era that conservative Germans wanted to return to when they spoke of making Germany great again. It also saw the split between Social Democrats and Communists which was so fateful in the fall of the Wiemar Republic. In this period Germany also had it's industrial explosion which catapulted it to neck and neck competition with the other great powers of the world and the beginning of modern colonialism, two factors which were of major importance in the lead up to the first world war. \n\nThe War itself can't be understated either. Though it was incredibly demoralizing, many German's believed that victory was always just around the corner because of the control on media reporting by the military and monarch, so when they finally lost it was a total shock to most. \"Defeat snatched in the last second from the jaws of victory\", and it was this shock, and inability to cope with such a sudden and unexpected result, along with the empire falling and becoming a republic, which created the [Stab-in-the-back myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) which became a main plank in all far-right rhetoric afterwards. \n\nThe other factor that many people either seem to not know, or simplify away is that antisemitism was endemic far before WWI. Too often a hear garbage like '...and then Hitler convinced the german people that the jews were the cause of all their problems', which is utter nonsense. The Nazis merely played on an incredibly common, though mostly either casual or abstract, prejudice, and were by no means the first in politics to have success doing so. As far as ideology goes, the nazis didn't really invent anything new. They just sampled and blended things that were already in the air. Frankly their rise isn't a story of strict ideologues coming to power through astute argument, but rather a group bent on power and willing to say just about anything to win support. More broadly their targets were Jews, Marxists, 'cultural Bolsheviks' (uncomfortably similar to 'cultural Marxists' if you ask me), feminists, sex educators, department store owners (who were mostly jewish for historically contingent reasons), social democrats, modernist artists, and much much more. \n\nOther important lead-up events include the Kapp Putsch, the hyperinflation of '23-'24, The Beer Hall Putsch and the following trial, the ever present street fighting between paramilitary organizations from the communists, social democrats, nazis, and conservatives, and then the Depression. \n\nTo me, that's where the important history is, far more than the politicking and campaign strategies that got the nazis from a protest vote party to being in power. The political environment that gave birth to the nazis was a long time in its creation, and even the simple picture I gave above doesn't nearly capture all the important threads that went into why what happened happened. I just want to try to show how history is long and the past has a huge bearing on the outcome of the future.

Hillary then [researched and helped prepare the CDF report that became a major catalyst for enacting what is now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act](http://www.childrensdefense.org/newsroom/cdf-in-the-news/press-releases/2013/honoring-hillary-clinton.html)\n* In 1975, after she was appointed to defend that rapist by a judge (she tried to rescue herself and was denied, plus he pled guilty under her counsel), she [helped launch the first rape crisis hotline in Arkansas and started an educational campaign about sexual violence against women](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/05/01/a-more-or-less-definitive-guide-to-hillary-clinton-s-record-on-law-and-order#.LkumoZANx)\n* in 1977, worked for [the Legal Services Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Services_Corporation), a non-profit corporation established by the government to ensure low-income people would be able to get legal assistance if needed.
