They have consequently been willing, even eager to indulge his growing number of fabulations and waking daydreams. *And* because he has likely fired anybody who ever gave him a reality check that was more than trivial in nature, who put concentrated effort into dragging him out of his self-absorbed fantasies, or who sat him down and firmly demonstrated that he was labouring under an ever-increasing series of self-induced misapprehensions and misperceptions. Those who saluted the boss and did what he wanted, no matter how counterproductive or outright nonsensical it was, thrived. Those who tried too hard to make him see sense, became debris in his wake.\n\nThis is why Trump constantly reverses his positions, then is able to keep a straight face while claiming, \"I never said that\"; he doesn't actually believe he *did*. This is why he honestly believes he has the innate intelligence to school the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces about battlefield tactics. This is why he actually thinks he has \"one of the world's best memories\", despite having sat down in a witness box on multiple occasions, and in each instance stated, \"I don''t remember\" over, and over, and over. This is why he really, truly thinks he possesses the rhetorical and diplomatic skills to successfully tear up and renegotiate highly complex and abstruse international trade agreements, without bringing serious economic consequence down upon the nation. He's not blowing smoke - he *really thinks* he has these skills and advantages over us mere mortals.\n\nThis is why he has spent so many hours watching cable news and tweeting about what he saw at 3AM, and has spent so little time listening to his policy advisors; the right's media echo chamber supports not only the fantasy world-picture he has created for himself, but steadily reinforces his rightful and central place within it.  Whereas most of his campaign advisors only try to drag him out of his warm, soft, well-lubricated waking daydream, and back into a cold, hard, dry, here-and-now that is much less supportive of his delusions. This is why he insists that attendance at his rallies are a better indication of his support, than are objective polls: the *rallies* support the world-fantasy in which he is now 100% emotionally invested; the *polls* contradict it. And he naturally gravitates to things that confirm his fantasies, and spurns things that demonstrate their insubstantial and ephemeral nature.\n\nFinally, this explains exactly why he has spent more on *hats* than on polling to keep track of his standing. It's easy for him to fabulate and imagine fantasy polls that show him strongly in the lead, and that he doesn't have to worry ... but he hasn't yet submerged himself deeply enough into his self-induced and nearly perpetual imaginings to actually hallucinate *hats* that do not exist in objective, three dimensional reality.", "Imagine if Obama said ONE of the things Trump has.
