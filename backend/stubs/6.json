When in fact the fact-checkers are no different than the biased left-leaning reporters and columnists at these papers and on networks. But the fact-check, the idea that it is a fact-check story is designed to say to you that it is objective and analytically fair, and all it is is a vehicle for them to do opinion journalism under the guise of fairness.

In France, Belgium, the US, Spain, etc.\n\nThe right wing points towards refugees and immigrants from the middle east. Not only are these people the most antagonized by the public, they're also the least likely to be ISIS sympathizers, because they have been victimized by ISIS to the point of fleeing their homelands. These are Muslims. They practice Islam. ISIS and it's sympathizers are going around during the holy month of Ramadan, raping and murdering 13-14 year old girls, and shooting up night clubs, when they should be fasting, repenting on their sins, and getting closer to God (Allah). \n\nWe have enough blowhards and bigots making this about Islam. We don't need our state heads and political figures legitimizing it.\n\nThe KKK consists of 5-8K members now, and peaked at 3-6 million members in the 1920s, about 1 in 19 Americans at the time. That was less than 100 years ago. That means there are likely way more Americans who grew up in klan/ ex klan households than there are ISIS sympathizers in all the countries around the globe. Some of them attack IRS buildings, black churches, or health clinics.\n\nMy state, Minnesota, has the largest Somalian population on the planet outside of Somalia itself. Somalian Muslims tend to be significantly less educated and Poorer than other Muslims in America, due to their relatively recent immigration, language barriers, and the war torn status of Somalia. Also, Minnesota is very segregated, resulting in a very insular community. Yet, they've thrived on entrepreneurship, and despite being an attractive target of recruitment for Al-Shabab and ISIS (and they have had some success, I admit - New York and Minnesota have the most arrests related to ISIS conspirators within the US), the communities remain vigilant in fighting against it. \n\n\nI refuse to condemn these people's religion when they are preyed upon by corrupt organizations and demagogues and, despite all circumstances, continue to resist such organizations and remain devoted to their communities and committed to living a peaceful lifestyle while adhering to the tenants of their religion. To do so would be to undermine all the honorable efforts our government and these communities continue to make for themselves, each other, and the rest of us.\n"], "links": ["5bgp1x", "5bfz5d",
