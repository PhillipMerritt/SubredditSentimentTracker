{"comments": ["Although this has been a sad and troubling day for many people I think it has been an extremely valuable catalyst for reflection on the current state of the Western world.\n\nSupport for Trump, much like Brexit, was based upon an extremely widespread feeling that average people are not getting their fair share of the benefits of globalisation. This is neither a specifically Democrat or Republican problem, and people have been saying it one way or another for years.\n\nIt was also the foundation of Sanders' campaign. The difference is that Sanders blamed deregulation and big corporate bonuses while Trump blamed immigration and open borders. I'm sure that there are elements of truth to both of these positions.\n\nWhat Trump has shown us is that this issue is now so potent that a candidate, regardless of his flaws or his 'unelectability', can become president almost entirely by promising to change the status quo. \n\nWhile personally I deplore Trump for his positions on race, gender and religion, I also do not believe that this is the end of the line for the liberal ideals of tolerance, progress and diversity. I do not believe that the Democratic party is dead, but I believe that it needs to heed the call of the electorate, and focus on delivering a message that combines these ideals with policies that ensure the average, working class American is not left behind either. By appealing to intellectual elites and refusing to drastically overhaul the 'establishment' the Democrats have missed a big opportunity for real grassroots change.\n\nIn short, I think that Sanders-brand progressive liberalism is the only future for the Democratic party.", "Not just this year.

This is why we lost Michigan.  This is why we lost North Carolina.  Because of this fucking attitude right here.  You want to know why \"the masses\" the poor, working white man, the bread and butter of this country, didn't vote Democract?  Because all the way, up until it was too late, they acted like they didn't need their vote.  \"Oh, are you uneducated?  Sorry, we don't need your kind to vote for us\"  \"Oh, are you not as socially liberal as we'd prefer you to be?  Vote for the fascist, he's right over thataway\".\n\nChina is laughing at us, because they get to be elitist fucks while pretending to be communists.  They get to have their cake and eat it too.  That's nothing to fucking admire.  Democracy isn't the problem.  Not giving people enough of a reason to vote for us was the problem, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.  Would the prospect of voting against someone even \"worse\" help?  Absolutely.  But not when you drive away every potential voter for not having been on board since the beginning.  And when the other guy welcomes them with open arms.  With a hat and a coat.  \n\nAnd here we fucking all are, sore losers trying to blame the poor bastard who lost their automation industry job because the economy moves faster than any generation can sanely be expected to keep up with.  And we have nothing to offer them but more of the same, you think they're gonna agree with that?  So they vote for the guy whose at least selling them something, at least wants their vote, at least tries to level with them.  And what do we fucking do when we realized what fools' we've all been?  Line up the scapegoat pinata and start hitting.  Yeah, democracy as a system, that's the problem here.  All those poor, stupid people who just don't know what's good for them.  In fact, we should let them know!  As loudly as fucking possible.  Well whoop-dee doo da day guys, now we can set ourselves up to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory all over again in 2020.  That's the takeaway from all this.  When we lose an election because people don't like being talked down to by the elitists, we remedy the situation by acting like a bunch of indignant, elitist little shits.  Bravo guys.  Let's walk away from this and learn zero lessons about what we should have done differently.  Society crumbles when it's people lose their principles.  ", "Sanders voter here. I'm taking zero joy in this. ", "I'm a thirty year old woman and a feminist. I can tell you that not even dragging me through glass shards could force me to vote for that corrupt sack of crap. She has a vagina? So do I. You know what real feminism is? Not voting for someone just because they're a woman but because they are *qualified* for the position. \n\nI voted third party. And yes, I would've voted for Bernie (and did during the primaries). Calling the massive amount of women who supported Sanders \"Bernie Bros\" was a stupid move. \n\nEdit: I find it extremely disgusting that a large group of you, who claim to be 'enlightened' and 'kind' in your support of Hillary Clinton, are also the same people who as SOON as a woman doesn't agree with you is eligible to have her *pussy* grabbed. I find it obscene that you think I don't understand the importance of Planned Parenthood, and the right to abortions. After all, this article we're discussing is about college-educated white women. Did it occur to you that almost every college educated white woman like myself has had and used birth control at some point?\n\nRoe v. Wade is far, far more important to folks like myself than you realize. Our right to do with our bodies as we please is crucial- something several of you seem to have determined can be ignored because I chose to vote 3rd party. But did it occur to you that perhaps some of us realized that the \"lesser of two evils\" is still *condoning evil*? That we have to take a stand at some point, and say that we are no longer willing to put people like the corrupt, untrustworthy monstrosity of Hillary Clinton in the White House where she will continue her destructive path against the environment and foreign policy- where she LAUGHS, talking about little girls being raped?- that maybe we have to stop telling our establishment that the \"lesser of two evils\" is acceptable? Because they will KEEP fielding their WORST candidates possible as long as they aren't \"as evil\" as the alternative? \n\nThey didn't want Bernie because they don't want real change. But they COUNTED on people like me not to vote against our best interests. I will take the fight to my Senator and my House Representative, I will take the fight to the streets and rally every vote as best as I can, I will threaten and conjole and sue my way through the next four years if I have to, but I will NOT continue to allow a corrupt and disgusting establishment to continue to count on me being willing to turn my back on what we NEED in order to preserve the few freedoms we've already won.\n\nFurthermore, we've already won them! We can take them back if some asshole pushes us again. We can mobilize in greater numbers now than ever before and accomplish what we need to accomplish but another war-hungry, money-grubbing establishment candidate who wants to screw our future into the ground is the last thing we need.\n\nI mourn what will become of our environment. I mourn the hardships we will face under this presidency. But do you know what I hate more even than that? The secret misogynist assholes who were only willing to value my right to my body as long as I fell in line with their beliefs. The bastards who feel confident in saying since I voted third party, I voted Trump, and that makes me ignorant and puts my pussy on the line to be grabbed. You want to talk about what's really wrong? It's *you*. My body is only sacred as long as I agree with you? You entitled pricks.\n\nFriendly reminder; if you look at the polls, if every single person who voted 3rd party voted one way or another it wouldn't have changed the outcome. In other words *no*, it's not the people who voted 3rd party you're mad at. It's all the women who are too afraid of telling you they voted for Trump because you clearly don't respect their right to control their bodies when they say they disagree with you. Maybe if you weren't secretly waiting for the moment a woman says \"I feel differently\" to unleash vitriol and hatred on them, those women in your life who voted Republican would feel comfortable telling you why. And if that was the case, maybe you could try to actually make a change in politics that would encourage them to vote the way you want them to.", "&gt; I voted third party.\n\nWell as a fellow Bernie voter in the primary, I want to congratulate you on your victory over Clinton and the Democrats last night. \n\nNow we have Trump as the President elect, and he's totally not corrupt, or a bigot, or a lying dishonest tax avoiding sack of crap representing the absolute 0.1% of our country. I'm sure Trump will do tremendously great things for women everywhere, and feminism has a really bright future!!\n\nJust remember that third party voters have zero right to complain about Trump or any of the shit that he and his republicans say and do over the next four years (or lifetime for the new SCOTUS judge).

But the worst of them all was indeed the Washington Post.  Their snobbery against Bernie throughout the campaign was atrocious.  Dana Milbank and Jonathan Capehart can fuck right off.  If anyone wants a good (infuriating) long read on this subject, consider reading [this essay](http://harpers.org/archive/2016/11/swat-team-2/).  It tears WaPo a new one.  Here's a good excerpt explaining where their writers are coming from:\n\n&gt;The Washington Post, with its constant calls for civility, with its seemingly genetic predisposition for bipartisanship and consensus, is more than the paper of record for the capital\u2014it is the house organ of a meritocratic elite, which views the federal city as the arena of its professional practice. Many of its leading personalities hail from a fairly exalted socioeconomic background (as is the case at most important American dailies). Its pundits are not workaday chroniclers of high-school football games or city-council meetings. They are professionals in the full sense of the word, well educated and well connected, often flaunting insider credentials of one sort or another. They are, of course, a comfortable bunch. And when they look around at the comfortable, well-educated folks who work in government, academia, Wall Street, medicine, and Silicon Valley, they see their peers.\n\n&gt;The professionalization of journalism is a well-known historical narrative. James Fallows, in Breaking the News (1996), describes how journalism went from being \u201ca high working-class activity\u201d to an occupation for \u201ccollege boys\u201d in the mid-1960s. The Washington Post\u2019s role in this story, as a compulsive employer of Ivy League graduates, is also well known. Indeed, the concentration of obnoxious Ivy Leaguers at the Post was once so great, Fallows writes, that editor Leonard Downie (who went to Ohio State) was known among his colleagues as \u201cLand-Grant Len.\u201d At present, five of the eight members of the Post\u2019s editorial board are graduates of Ivy League universities.\nNow, consider the recent history of the Democratic Party. Beginning in the 1970s, it has increasingly become an organ of this same class. Affluent white-collar professionals are today the voting bloc that Democrats represent most faithfully, and they are the people whom Democrats see as the rightful winners in our economic order. Hillary Clinton, with her fantastic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and her life of striving and her much-commented-on qualifications, represents the aspirations of this class almost perfectly. An accomplished lawyer, she is also in with the foreign-policy in crowd; she has the respect of leading economists; she is a familiar face to sophisticated financiers. She knows how things work in the capital. To Washington Democrats, and possibly to many Republicans, she is not just a candidate but a colleague, the living embodiment of their professional worldview.\n\n&gt;In Bernie Sanders and his \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d on the other hand, I believe these same people saw something kind of horrifying: a throwback to the low-rent Democratic politics of many decades ago. Sanders may refer to himself as a progressive, but to the affluent white-collar class, what he represented was atavism, a regression to a time when demagogues in rumpled jackets pandered to vulgar public prejudices against banks and capitalists and foreign factory owners. Ugh.\n\n&gt;Choosing Clinton over Sanders was, I think, a no-brainer for this group. They understand modern economics, they know not to fear Wall Street or free trade. And they addressed themselves to the Sanders campaign by doing what professionals always do: defining the boundaries of legitimacy, by which I mean, defining Sanders out.", "He also knows that once the republicans take all the branches of government his legacy is one of the first things to go. ", "They won't listen. They don't care what the facts are only about how they *feel*.", "To the Clinton democrats you know how you're gonna feel watching Clinton come out and concede. That's how we Bernie supporters felt at the DNC, gutted, cheated, and crying to Simon and Garfunkel ", "It must suck to be Bernie right now. You've been a voice in the wilderness since the 60s standing up for causes you believe in and fighting for the rights of the disenfranchised. You climbed the political ranks from the absolute bottom to the top and decide to run for president. You put on a supremely strong, positive, respectful campaign that spoke to the lower and middle class. You competed in a primary the DNC would never let you win even though the analytics overwhelmingly indicate you would have wiped the floor with Trump. When you lost, you did it with grace and recognized and supported the victor because you realize how unimaginably dangerous the opposition was. Now, the Democrat lost because she was woefully out of touch with the American people. The same voter pool you appealed was swayed by a charlatan, a person who has never had to go through 1/1000 of the shit you've had to deal with in your life. Now, at age 75, instead of being able to ride off into the sunset with your head held high, you have to hop back into the fight against demagoguery, indecency, nationalism, and bigotry. \n\n\nMy heart goes out to you, Bern. ", "o now its time?", "I mean think of the absolute insanity of this:  The whole point of the primaries is to ask the American people who they like best all so the party can have the best chance possible at winning the general election.  _Everything_ that Hillary and DWS and by extension the DNC did went against that.  They set up an absolute delusion from the start and now they're surprised about the outcome?  They crafted the narrative for the media, they relied on super delegates to present a false notion of \"she already won\" from the get-go, they spent _millions of dollars influencing grass roots discussions online_, they siphoned money from races that democrats ended _losing_ last night, and they continually attacked and degraded the guy who closed a 60 point gap in less than a year and had proven to appeal to the independents needed for a general election.
