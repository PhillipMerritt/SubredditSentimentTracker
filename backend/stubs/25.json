The 2016 election may just be the major wake up call the establishment Dems needed to finally stop f-ing around and start to strongly acknowledge the growing progressive base.", "I'm sure the GOP controlled house and senate will be impartial and seek justice against president Trum-BAHAHAHA ... oh man. I almost said the whole thing.", "Ive seen both sides and what I'm stunned about frankly is the average education and information level of the us population. Sorry, but from a personal standpoint, I'm flabbergasted.\n\nI'm observing as someone who is lucky enough in reading 12 languages, being fluent in 6 (I don't code, I don't do magic, thats my shtick) and who particularly enjoys confronting national vs international press to see discrepancies, posturing, etc. I just find this interesting, nothing new there.\n\nHowever, this is how I justify by saying \"nope, you absolutely cannot compare right wing media with the rest - it's in its own universe of lying/crazy\". I'm not being partisan, I don't have any bias, I just share what I observed.", "Bernie could have split the working class with Trump and beaten him. Fox News has spent years calling everyone a socialist so calling Bernie one would not have done much damage.", "The GOP only leaked his picks duh. He has to be coronated first!", "It turned out that they produce more hatred aggressively pushing back against normal people. Noise machines, fire alarms, bullying professors, witch hunting - enjoy the result, I hope they feel better now.", "Maybe noone in your state political machine was trying to actively supress the vote in your area by limiting the number of voting points and placing them in hard to reach places?", "Mr. Trump has a hard time with numbers. He thought the opposite.", "If muslims have to stand up and disavow \"radical islamic terrorism\" which they never fucking supported in the first place I think white conservatives have to stand up and disavow the KKK publicly.", "People are drowning in healthcare childcare, and education expenses. I haven't seen a single Republican policy to really address those issues and certainly not one that follows other successful examples around the world. At least the Democrats were pushing for policies like paid sick leave and expanding healthcare to all.\n\nI don't understand how anyone looks at Republican policies and sees tangible improvements in their life or for their families. I'd love to hear from a Trump supporter what actual improvements they expect from Trump other than vague \"more jobs\" or \"more money to spend on consumer goods\".", "&gt;It kind of annoys me how the Democratic Party just expects votes from Asians. What did they even offer them during the election?\n\nReading stuff like this I always wonder: why should a major political party be in the business of doing favors for different racial groups? Is it really the government's job to \"offer\" concessions to asian people, white people, black people, etc?\n\nIf our objective is to be a unified nation - one people, an American people - why are we putting people in groups based on race and then offering them shit? Why not ask \"what is good for all Americans\" rather than \"what is good for Asians?\" \n\nIn my opinion that's a dangerous and cynical way of looking at politics. Because - if we are going to go down that road - white people will demand that politicians pander to *them,* too. Game theory dictates that in such a paradigm *all* racial groups *must* unify to work against one another else they will be at a disadvantage. \n\nThat is no way to run a country. We must reject the identity politics and cynical race baiting of the left wing if we are to survive as a country. I hope and pray that DJT realizes this and acts accordingly.\n\nAm I making sense or no?", "Yeah I find it hilarious that democrats are taking solace in the fact that Hillary won the popular vote. Are they forgetting what she was up against?\n\nBeating Trump by 0.3% in the popular vote is like beating Stephen Hawking by 1 point in a game of basketball. \n\n", "\nBernie plans on submitting
