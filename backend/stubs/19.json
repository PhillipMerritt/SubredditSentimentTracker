{"comments": ["Bernie understood this election from day one.  He had his finger on the pulse of the nation and he was silenced by the establishment and the DNC.  He saw which way the wind was blowing.  This was his moment.  We're all suffering the consequences now.  DNC if you ever want to win another election - don't shove a candidate down our throats.  Natural grassroots movements are always stronger.  You can't artificially create that kind of movement.  It was obvious with her empty rallies.  The fire wasn't there.  If the Republicans had run an establishment politician..maybe it would have worked.  Maybe America would have flipped a coin and landed on Hillary.  Say what you will about Trump, his support was real and produced tangible results where it counted.  What a fuck up by the DNC.", "&gt; \u201cTo the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. **To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.**\u201d\n\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\n\n", "Bernie touched the same population that Trump touched and are alienated by Hillary. Oh well", "If Democrats are smart they will line up behind Bernie and let him lead them in the Senate.", "Yet some Hillary supporters are on Twitter still putting him down for his focus on class. Uh jackasses, you just got your asses handed to you because you didn't focus on class enough.", "I could use some progressive leadership now that the world has turned upside down. Thank you Bernie.\n\n", "So true they are already claiming Tim Kaine as the future of the party. No one who lost to Trump can be the future of the party, sorry.", "Bernie Sanders for the Senate Minority Leader.  Schumer is too cozy with wall street exactly the opposite message this election sent us.", "-Bernie was polling [10+ points](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) better than Hillary in all polls leading up to the convention.\n\n-Bernie won handily during the primaries in the exact states that Hillary lost in the general where white workers were desperate for change and populism.\n\n-Trump was a flawed messenger but he won as a result of this perceived change to the system that Clinton herself embodies.\n\n-This message of change, upended every single other controversy Donald Trump had, which would have immediately sunk every other campaign. \"Family values\" is just as much of a republican-montra as those \"godless commies,\" yet, people still didn't care. \n\n-Bernie talks about things that people actually care about and agree with. He doesn't skirt or spin or sound like a robot, and he puts it into simple terms that everyone can understand.\n\n-Bernie has been fighting against the \"system\" his entire life, cementing his principles. Sec. Clinton typifies everything that some people perceive as [corrupt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12mJ-U76nfg) about that [system](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate?id=N00000019) and has benefited [immensely](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/) from it.\n\n-Bernie's base of energized voters would get out the vote, especially in the suburban areas where Sec. Clinton had such a hard time \n\n-Many people were voting [against](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/02/for-many-voters-its-not-which-presidential-candidate-theyre-for-but-which-theyre-against/), not for a candidate this election, due to each candidate's historically low approval ratings. Before the election and currently, Bernie has the highest approval ratings among all Senators. In short, he is likable.\n\n-Bernie is a crowd-sourced candidate. He doesn't take any money from Wall Street or billionaires, and he himself is upper middle class. He is just as much of an outsider, if not more so, than the Donald, and he has a better message. \n\n-I do not believe there would have been as many \"Hillary-or-bust\" people who believe that the DNC \"rigged\" the system since the wide consensus is that the opposite is true. Many of these Bernie-or-busters are millennials as well, who supported Bernie because of his progressivism and against Hillary because of her centrism.\n\n-Bernie had stadium wide crowds that only increased every month he was campaigning. When he started his campaign, he was speaking to a crowd of less than 30 on the lawn outside of the whitehouse. By the middle of his campaign, he was drawing 30,000 [people](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/sanders-campaign-claims-record-breaking-crowd-new-york-rally-n557421) in New York City. There is no reason to suggest why this number would not grow to even larger numbers during the general, emboldening his populist persona.\n\n-Bernie is an old, salt of the earth, New Yorker with white hair and a thick Brooklyn accent. He mimics the same people who voted for Trump in droves this election.\n\n-Bernie was not under criminal investigation at the time he was campaigning.\n\n-Bernie is not married to a person wrought with controversy and a notorious womanizer.\n\n-Bernie is not wrought with controversy.\n\n-I do not believe that Bernie's campaign would have been tarnished by wikileaks in the same way it had done so to Sec. Clinton's campaign. One reason for this is that Bernie Sanders is not as well known as Sec. Clinton, and therefore not as big of a target. I also do not believe there would be much motivation to do so considering that his campaign managers (Jeff Weaver) hacks would only consist of campaign strategizing whereas Podesta's hacks included that and other things concerning the Secretary while she was in the Whitehouse. He also never gave any speeches to banks that could inevitably get hacked..so there's that.\n\n-Bernie also does not have a history of health issues that have partially marred Sec. Clinton's campaign and can be linked back to early [2013](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-is-discharged-from-hospital-after-blood-clot.html). As you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP_J6gmJYiU) the man is pretty fit for a 74 year old.\n\n\n\nEverything I can recall atm for why I think Bernie unquestionably would have fared better than Sec. Clinton in the general.

The only living wage jobs left in their area may be the coal factory or working in strip mines or going out to job sites to build oil pipes. Jobs that yes, not good for the environment and not healthy spaces to live near but... that's what they have. That is what keeps food on the table. Families like this have stories about dad or grandad working their entire lives at a factory with union wages and retirement benefits. Something they were denied when that same factory laid off workers and moved to places where the work could be done cheaper.

The DNC ignored these people, in some ways they mocked them directly thinking they were just small town ignorant folk, not numerous enough to court. The RNC ignored them too, has for decades as well but Trump figured out how to appeal to them directly. Appeal to their hopes as well as their fears.
