Ingoglia \u2014 who backed off Wednesday following a compromise \u2014 also said Snipes had erred by giving the public only a half-hour each morning to observe.\n\n&gt;Still, to ensure faith in the county\u2019s elections process, Judge John D. Fry \u2014 one of three judges who make up Broward\u2019s canvassing board \u2014 said he told members of both parties Wednesday that he would be present during ballot canvassing every day until the entire board convenes again Monday morning. He also said he would entertain all requests to observe the canvassing of ballots.\n\n&gt;\u201cI told them anything that we do that you want to observe, I\u2019d love to have you here,\u201d Fry said.\n\n&gt;On Thursday, two attorneys from each party \u2014 Larry Davis and Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan on the Democrat side, David Shestokas and Joe Nixon for the Republican National Lawyers Association \u2014 took him up on his offer.\n\n&gt;Fry gave them the tour of Snipes\u2019 mail-in ballot processing operation, which consisted of two large rooms and about 50 visible employees at her Lauderhill headquarters off State Road 7. In the first room, Fry showed them where mail-in ballots, after being received in their sealed envelopes, are initially scanned through a computerized system and sorted. Then, next door, Fry said multiple employees with blue rubber gloves go over each individual ballot envelope to ensure that voters have penned their signature \u2014 and that it matches the signature on record.\n\n&gt;Ballots without signatures or with signatures that vary from those on file are flagged, and then the entire batch is re-entered and sorted again in the computer. The problematic ballots set aside are then given to a small group of employees with laptops who contact voters to inform them that they need to correct the problem with their ballot. The envelopes of ballots authenticated by elections staff \u2014 trained by handwriting experts \u2014 are cut in the first room and can\u2019t be challenged on the basis of signature, Fry acknowledged.\n\n&gt;At last count, roughly 700 ballots were missing signatures, and about 35 had problematic signatures, according to Kevron Aird, an assistant for the Broward supervisor\u2019s voter services director.\n\n&gt;The entire process is conducted each day under the supervision of an alternate of the canvassing board, Fry said. The board itself will begin reviewing and deciding the validity of any unresolved absentee ballots when it convenes on Monday, he said, and will display each ballot on a monitor for the public to see.\n\n&gt;**\u201cI verified we\u2019re doing it the right way,\u201d Fry said.**\n\n&gt;In statements Thursday, both the Republican Party of Florida and the party\u2019s lawyers association said they have representatives observing elections across the state, not just in Broward, **and the party said it only sent its letter after Snipes failed to respond to earlier attempts to address concerns about the process. The state party said it was \u201cpleased\u201d with Fry\u2019s presence and transparency.**\n\nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article112431667.html\n\nAnd here's the article from Thursday when the Republicans first accused the county: \n\nSource:  http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article112183717.html\n\nSo again, come back when ACTUAL news organizations, and not just high profile right wing internet celebrities and Republican Buzzfeed are reporting \"Election fraud!  Election fraud! PROVEN!\"  Because that's not what the RNC is saying, that's not what the judge is saying, that's not what the local papers are saying.  \n\n\"But they have a signed affadavit!\"  Yeah, the State Attorney's office is aware, affadavits aren't magic bullets that bend space and time to make everything you want to believe correct.  Have you READ the affadavit?  And do you know what the Broward State Attorney's office response was?  She was mistaken.\n\n&gt;It was determined that the ballots were being completed by SOE staff on behalf of overseas military personnel who had voted by faxing their ballots to the election office. The fax paper does not scan into the voting machines and the votes must be transferred onto a ballot that can be scanned. State law allows such a transfer of vote to a computer ballot.\n\nThat's from a press release by the Broward State Attorney's Office. The source of the quote is the Independent Journal Review (it's in one of the updates at the bottom of their original article about this).  This was corroborated by the confirmed Twitter account of Broward County's local newspaper, the Sun Sentinel 15 hours ago, although they did not release any excerpts from the release.  It is not publicly available, I checked.  I might call them later and ask to see it, but for now, the Sun Sentinel has also confirmed it in two different tweets.\n\nSource:  https://twitter.com/browardpolitics/status/794646144680923136\n\nhttps://twitter.com/browardpolitics/status/794646020823117824\n\n", "&gt; mass voter fraud that Democrats will have committed by and on election day\n\nYou have a source for that?", "Not talking about that at all also there's already hard evidence of him denying black people housing, so letting his wealthy black business associates play doesn't mean much.

If you don't live in DC or nearby you may not know this but they have a single non voting representative in the House. That's it. Obviously this is a problem to the people who live there because they have no representation in Congress even though they live in the same city as it so there are groups trying to do this every year. \n\nNow why wouldn't Maryland just want to absorb DC? All the goodies that come along with having the nation's capital in your state, sounds great right? Well there are a lot of problems with that, foremost being that would in all likelihood require a constitutional amendment and secondly nobody in either place actually want it. Poll after poll show Maryland doesn't want their land back and DC is a living breathing entity that the residents believe they shouldn't have to change just to be enfranchised in the nation's capital. \n\nSo, why hasn't it happened yet? One word: Republicans. Go look on 538 and see what part of the country is the most liberal. You scroll down and you will see DC all the way at the bottom, it is the most liberal cluster of electoral votes there is. So they know it would 99.9% mean there would be 2 new Democratic senators and a good few reps that will certainly be Democrats as well. After everything about voter suppression this year (see NC, WI, Broward County in FL, etc.) people can't deny it anymore. Compounded by the fact that per the constitution Congress has unilateral control over the district (they have a city council and such, but Congress can really do whatever they want whenever they want if they so choose) you have to wonder why it hasn't happened yet. \n\nThis is a fascinating study in American politics, as horrible as it that Wyoming has more representation in Congress than the people living a mile away from it (no hate on Wyoming, you know why I chose you). \n\nThis referendum will pass with flying colors, but just watch for the Republican obstructionism that will make this go flat. Sadly, it's inevitable. As unpopulated as they are, places like Idaho and South Dakota still have one vote in ratifying a constitutional amendment and you can probably guess which way they'd vote IF it for some mindfucking reason it makes it through Congress.

A constitutional amendment would not be needed if the current DC was shrunk to encompass the federal zone I described. Then the remaining land could be added as a state by a simple vote in congress.

", "Well the DNC has a collection of bugs he can choose from. ", "Three things to note here. \n\nFirst and most importantly; two police officers died because of this. By all means and accounts they were nothing but respectful and they were murdered for doing their job. It's horrible. No matter how much any of us give our political hot takes, we should never lose sight of the fact that officers are losing their lives. And regardless of who is the one pulling the trigger, it is a terrible loss. My heart goes out to their friends, family, and precincts. \n\nSecondly; Trump and Giuliani both connected this attack with the Black Lives Matter movement because police were shot.  (See: Edit 1) So without any ID on the attacker, the only information that they need to blame this attack on black people is that a cop died. That's racist and it's shameful.\n\nThirdly; no, this man does not reflect every Trump supporter. But it is horrifically alarming that this type of person exists in our country. He went to a football game at a predominantly black school (see: edit 2) and waved a confederate flag. He was causing a disturbance, was asked to leave, and kept yammering on about his rights. Two weeks later, he murdered two police officers. The thing that we should take away from which candidate he supports is that it seems like every single person who behaves this way (confederate flag, racism) seems to be a Trump supporter. Even the KKK has endorsed Trump. And that speaks volumes, not about Trump supporters, but about who Trump is. His rhetoric attracts bigots. That's what we should be focusing on as far as politics are concerned. It's the same logic of not every rectangle is a square, but every square is a rectangle; not every Trump supporter is a racist, but every racist is a Trump supporter. \n\nAgain, let's not forget that two lives were lost when we bring this crime to a national stage. It's a horrible loss that is much too frequent. \n\nEdit 1- there is a fair bit of reading between the lines in this article. \n\n&gt; This week, Trump tweeted that he was praying for the families of those killed in Iowa and offered words of support for police. Giuliani, who was stumping for Trump in Iowa hours after the shooting, said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to politicize this, but let me give a politicized take on a previous police killing. Just, you know, coincidentally.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not an isolated incident. This is happening all over the country.\u201d\n\nSo Trump only offered his prayers, Giuliani connected this shooting with others. The article contrasts Trump's reaction to this shooting with the shooting earlier this year in Baton Rogue which involved a black shooter. I'd made the jump that the difference was racially based, but that doesn't have to be the case. However, given his entire body of work, you can't rule it out. \n\nEdit 2- the school isn't predominantly black, but an officer pointed out to the man that we was flying a confederate flag at an event where he knew there would be a lot of black people. Error on the school's racial make-up, but the point still stands. ", "Regardless of the numbers it's imperative you encourage your  friends and family to join you.

She will charge an \u201cexit tax\u201d for companies leaving the U.S. to settle up on their untaxed foreign earnings. She will close tax loopholes that let Wall Street money managers pay lower rates than some middle-class families. And she\u2019ll reward businesses that invest in good-paying jobs here in the United States.\n* Simplify and cut taxes for small businesses so they can hire and grow. The smallest businesses, with one to five employees, spend 150 hours and $1,100 per employee on federal tax compliance. That\u2019s more than 20 times higher than the average for far larger firms. We\u2019ve got to fix that.\n* Provide tax relief to working families from the rising costs they face. For too many years, middle-class families have been squeezed by rising costs for everything from child care to health care to affording college. Hillary will offer relief from these rising costs, including tax relief for Americans facing excessive out-of-pocket health care costs and for those caring for an ill or elderly family member.\n* Pay for ambitious investments in a fiscally responsible way. Hillary believes that we can afford to pay for ambitious, progressive investments in good-paying jobs, debt-free college, and other measures to strengthen growth, broaden opportunity, and reduce inequality.
