See: [Is Bernie Sanders Too Radical for America?](http://prospect.org/article/bernie-sanders-too-radical-america)\n\nLarge numbers of Americans across the political spectrum support much of Bernie's agenda but [a study](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) out of Princeton a couple years ago determined that the public has little to no influence on public policy, and only gets what it wants when it wants the same thing as powerful special interests.\n\nThe reasons for that discrepancy are many and complex: we have an electoral college which gives extra weight to the presidential votes of rural citizens, who tend to be more conservative. We have a Senate which over-represents those same rural citizens by giving them the same number of senators as citizens in more populous states. We have a system of voting that favors older, whiter, wealthier (and thus more conservative) voters. For example, you must re-register to vote every time you move, and liberals are more likely to move than conservatives (because liberals tend to be younger and poorer). We currently have Congressional districts that were largely drawn by Republicans in 2010 (since states are responsible for drawing their districts, and more states were under Republican control then). So in the 2012 and 2014 Congressional elections the Republicans took more seats than they received votes:\n\n[\ufeffGiven that Republicans will only win about 52 percent of votes in House races, how are they ending up with 57 percent of seats?](https://www.thenation.com/article/republicans-only-got-52-percent-vote-house-races/)\n\n[In 2012, the first congressional election after the last round of gerrymandering, Democratic House candidates won 50.59 percent of the vote \u2014 or 1.37 million more votes than Republican candidates \u2014 yet secured only 201 seats in Congress, compared to 234 seats for Republicans.](https://www.republicreport.org/2014/gerrymandering-rigged-the-2014-elections-for-republican-advantage/)\n\nEven at the very local level, who is more likely to show up to a city council meeting at 7pm to voice their concerns? Not poor people working a swing shift, or single moms watching their kids, or college students who have a late class. It's going to be old retirees with nothing else to do, and wealthy people who have a favorable work schedule and can hire a sitter to watch their kids while they go do their civic duty.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the influence of money in politics. You need to hire staff and consultants, rent office space and pay for the utilities, and print and send thousands of mailers. Depending on the size of the district and how competitive the race is, you could need to raise millions of dollars for even a relatively obscure office. That money has to come from somewhere.", "Liberal here.  That would be great. I would be happy.  Right now I'm on a plane. And trump is flying.  I'd be an idiot to want him to fail.

Every time someone goes to a hospital and can't afford the bill, everyone who does pay their bill covers it. Now since we're already paying for the emergency services of others, it seems to make sense to just pay it for everyone to begin with, and cut out insurance companies entirely. It reduces the cost, simplifies administration and billing.\n\nOnce we do that, and cover the emergency services of everyone, it becomes a good idea to reduce those costs. How do we do this? Regular checkups and preventative care. It's just plain less expensive to catch things early. So we may as well socialize basic care too.\n\nNow we've given everyone socialized emergency and basic care, paid for through taxes, and frankly we're spending less on it. The middle class and the poor get the largest benefits, as do small businesses.\n\nWe can still have insurance, to cover additional treatments past what the basic level is, but it's no longer a requirement.", "This. \nPeople forget this fact.
