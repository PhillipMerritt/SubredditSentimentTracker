I don't care if you vote for Trump (I wish I was not a supporter of his so my comments would have more meaning to you), but we (Repbulicans) were basically in the same boat.  We had the RNC telling us basically who we should choose.  They refused to support Trump (like the DNC did with Bernie).  They worked with his opponents to try to keep him from the nomination.\n\nI know most of you hate Trump - and I will be the first to admit he is not the perfect candidate.  But speaking from the heart - he is the guy WE chose.  You all (Bernie supporters) chose to side with a man that NEVER had a shot.  Now, he is out there reluctantly supporting her.  I do not agree with his politics, and I would never vote for him - but I do feel sorry for the position he has been put in.  In a couple years, he will be nothing but a footnote on the election.  Just like in my teens when Ross Perot pumped some enthusiasm into the election - Sanders will just be known as the \"loser\" of the primary.  \n\nIf you really supported him.

At least with Trump - you know where HE stands on an issue (even if he is not eloquent about how he says it).  With Clinton, it is very clear that her stance on various issues is told to her.  Look at some of the emails that show how every speech and every statement she gets is reviewed by 20 people to make sure it is \"crafted\" to appease the most people.  Look at times where her staff has said things like \"not sure where we should be on that issue - lets hold off\" (paraphrasing, not an exact quote).

You've heard me say this before, but with less than 48 hours to go until election day I think it bears repeating:  \n  \n#DON'T LET THESE NINNIES OFF THE HOOK!!!  \n  \nCongressional Republicans didn't rescind their endorsements [when he was calling for killing innocent civilians,](https://youtu.be/I1eXRXL0nkk?t=1m13s) when [he called African-Americans thugs,](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/592910662424223744) when [he asked gun owners to do something about Hillary Clinton,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELL-aYFgkXI) when [he questioned my President's ancestry and religion,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlpaEXWe3Zs) when [he implied that vaccinations cause autism,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G23Y8R-KcKA) when [he promised to ban a religion from immigrating to the United States,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7XaJlvJIg) when [he invited Russia to hack a US citizen,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNa2B5zHfbQ) when [he advocated for torture,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxZv1Wq2c28) when [he demeaned women (pick one),](https://i.imgur.com/sYqvfDR.png) or when [he said that Mexico was sending us rapists and criminals.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apjNfkysjbM)  \n  \nTheir endorsement stood through each and every indefensible thing he's said or done.    \n  \n#DONALD TRUMP WAS UNACCEPTABLE BEFORE THE FIRST ENDORSEMENT WAS EVER GIVEN.\n  \nAny sitting politician who endorsed this man before, during, or after this campaign deserves to lose their job.
