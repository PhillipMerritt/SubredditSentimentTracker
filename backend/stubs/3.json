As a quick side note, DADT made things better for gay servicemembers. It banned discrimination and harassment stemming from sexual orientation and removed the ban on gay servicemembers. While there were obviously zealous officers that didn't get the memo, and while it didn't remove the ban on openly gay servicemembers, it still helped. It actually came about when Bill Clinton tried to completely remove the ban on the LGBT+ community.\n\nIn 2000, [she became the first First Lady and to march in a gay pride parade](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/06/26/hillary-clinton-giuliani-march-in-ny-gay-parade/93eab33a-6e64-4c3b-9035-f8dbd1a2e30e/).\n\nIn 2004, [she spoke out on the Senate floor against a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1-r1YgK9I). I'm pretty sure at this point, everyone and their mothers have seen this YouTube video that shows Clinton saying something along the lines of \"marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman.\" The great irony of this video is that this phrase comes directly out of a speech by Clinton on the Senate floor against a proposed Constitutional amendment that would explicitly ban gay marriage. Her rhetoric in this speech, to me anyways, is brilliant. It opened a new avenue of attack against the amendment. The speech basically said that if you were against gay marriage, you could also be against the proposed amendment. I'm willing to bet that at least a single person changed their vote due to that speech. In the same, obvious vein, the speech shows that Clinton isn't at all against gay marriage. If she was, she wouldn't have given that speech. She would have simply said \"yea\".\n\nIn 2006, [she fought to preserve AIDS/HIV healthcare funding](http://votesmart.org/public-statement/177631/senator-clinton-presses-for-fair-share-of-ryan-white-funding-for-new-york#.U1aXMvldV8E)\n\nIn 2007, [she cosponsored legislation to reduce LGBT+ based hate crimes](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/1105/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s1105%22%5D%7D).\n\nAlso in 2007, [she supported lifting restrictions on LGBT+ servicemembers](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/2007-04-22-clinton-iowa_N.htm?csp=34).\n\nThroughout her tenure as Senator, [she repeatedly cosponsored ENDA to prevent employment discrimination based on sexual orientation](http://www.politico.com/pdf/PPM42_benhrc.pdf).\n\nIn 2009, [she extended heterosexual partner benefits to homosexual diplomats](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/us/24benefit.html).\n\nAlso in 2009, [she awarded GLIFAA as the Employee Resource Group of the year](https://www.usaid.gov/content/gays-and-lesbians-foreign-affairs-agencies-named-employee-resource-group-year).\n\nAgain in 2009, [she fought Uganda to promote human rights for the LGBT+ community](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2009a/12/133544.htm).\n\nIn 2010, [she made it easier for transgender Americans to change their passports to reflect their actual gender](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-2016-transgender-rights-passport-policy-state-department-lgbt-equality-214007).\n\nIn 2011, [she took a leading role in passing the first UN resolution protecting the LGBT+ community](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2011/03/158846.htm).\n\nAlso in 2011, [she secured a UNHRC statement against violence towards the LGBT+ community](http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2011/03/158846.htm).\n\nYet again in 2011, [she launched the Global Equality Fund to support human rights advocates](http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2013/215847.htm).\n\nAnd once more in 2011, [she made a historic speech at Geneva that declared that \"gay rights are human rights\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/clintons-geneva-accord-gay-rights-are-human-rights/2011/03/04/gIQAPUipcO_blog.html?utm_term=.bed838d044a0).\n\nAnd because she was a busy woman in 2011, [she announced that it was formal US foreign policy to support gay rights aboard](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/world/united-states-to-use-aid-to-promote-gay-rights-abroad.html?pagewanted=all).\n\nAnd throughout her tenure as Secretary of State, [she worked to protect the LGBT+ community in more ways than I can name](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/12/178341.htm).\n\nIn 2013, [she formally and publicly endorses gay marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RP9pbKMJ7c).\n\nWhile as a private citizen Clinton doesn't have as much clout as she did as a public servant, she still supports the LGBT+ cause.\n\nIn 2016, [she made a surprise appearance at another pride parade, making history as the first presidential candidate of a major party to do so](http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2016/6/27/hillary-clinton-made-history-new-york-pride-parade).\n\nCourtesy of /u/hcregna", "Oh look Vox spewing shit again.", "1) Clinton gets into the Whitehouse and feels no obligation whatsoever to change a thing.

This is a little excerpt from it: \n&gt;We\u2019ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true.

To the uninformed it's random, he could have picked any date, and it had to be some year. Turns out that 1965 is the year that the Immigration Act passed, which gutted a previous law which imposed quotes demanding that the intake of immigrants must reflect the proportion of those people in American society already. Essentially a measure taken intentionally to preserve the dominate proportion of white Americans. It was after that bill passing that the proportion of whites in America started to slowly shrink, and is seen as a major point of defeat to new nazis. But don't take my word for it.

", "I guarantee Trump will not formally concede. He is mentally incapable of doing so. Let me explain.\n\nTrump has a grandiose sense of self-importance. He routinely overestimates his abilities and inflates his accomplishments often appearing boastful and pretentious. He blithely assumes that others attribute the same value to his efforts and may be surprised when the praise he expects and feels he deserves is not forthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of his own accomplishments is an underestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. \n\nTrump is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, or brilliance. He ruminates about \"long overdue\" admiration and privilege and compares himself favorably with famous or privileged people. He believes that he is superior, special, or unique and expect others to recognize him as such.\n\nTrump believes that his needs are special and beyond the ken of ordinary people. His own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., \"mirrored\") by the idealized value that he assigns to those with whom he associates. He is likely to insist on having only the \"top\" person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or being affiliated with the \"best\" institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who disappoint him.\n\nTrump requires excessive admiration. His self-esteem is very fragile. He is preoccupied with how well he is doing and how favorably he is regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need for constant attention and admiration. He expects his arrival to be greeted with great fanfare. He may constantly fish for compliments, often with great charm. \n\nTrump\u2019s sense of entitlement, combined with his lack of sensitivity to the wants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others. Trump expects to be given whatever he wants or feels he needs, no matter what it might mean to others. For example, he may expect great dedication from others and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. He often uses special privileges and extra resources that he believes he deserves because he is so special. He has a lack of empathy and has difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others. He may be oblivious to the hurt his remarks may inflict. \n\nCharacterized by arrogant, haughty behaviors, Trump often displays snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes. For example, he may complain about a reporter's \"rudeness\" or \"stupidity\" or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician.\n\nVulnerability in self-esteem makes Trump very sensitive to \"injury\" from criticism or defeat. Although he may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt him and may leave him feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty. He may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack (e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re the puppet!\u201d). Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat.", "Except many Latinos in these areas probably know some illegal immigrants and know they aren't like Trump is painting them.

The point here is that shortly after Donald Trump said this, regardless of what he *meant to say*, people in his crowd started fighting with the guy, someone falsely accused him of brandishing a gun, and he was attacked and beaten up by Trump supporters until the secret service took him in, questioned him, and them immediately released him. \n\nI know the Trump people want to continue pretending that Trump personally fought off an assassin in an epic katana duel, but these are just the facts of that happened last night.
