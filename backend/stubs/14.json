Even the RWNJs are gonna be all \"President Hillary is a *monster!* Tim's cool, though. No complaints.\"", "Being a senior in college this year has caused me to reflect on my life up to this point and think about all of the factors that have contributed to my success. While many people feel that this election is the end of a long and harrowing (and to some depressing) experience, in reality this election symbolizes the true greatness of our country. Millions of people across the country will cast votes in an election that will shape the next four years of policy in our country and foreign policy all across the world, and will do it relatively peacefully.\n\nI strongly supported Bernie in the primaries, to the extent that I found myself as apart of the crowd hoping Hillary would be indicted, which would allow Bernie to face off in the general election. I was actively voter suppressed in the Connecticut primary and unable to vote for Bernie, which only furthered my anger. I never, ever considered voting for Trump, but I did consider not voting at all. I recognized that would be a tremendous mistake. Not voicing my opinion in such a contentious election would be irresponsible, and go against my core beliefs of civility. But this election season stressed me in ways I did not think were possible before. Trump, to me, is the antithesis of my morals and experiences. I understand the anger that can lead people to vote for him (or not vote at all), and therefore I won't bash those who will vote for him based off that anger.\n\nI will, however, voice my absolute disdain for those who believe the terrible things he says. Trump is a national disgrace, a man so vile that I would fear for the safety of my family, my friends, and my own future. The length and severity of his lies, alone, is enough. He has tweeted over one hundred times since 2008 that climate change is a Chinese hoax. His complete disregard of even basic diplomacy, shown by his comments on our involvement in NATO (the alliance responsible for the stability of the world as we know it), is disqualifying of a presidential candidate. The list is long enough to write a dissertation about. He is a demagogue, a man who wants to capture your emotions through hate filled speeches and then promise you of a better future with irrational policy and racist, sexist remarks. A man in Germany did this, and he killed over 10 million people by his own hand before he was forcefully removed from power.\n\nI study history, and I know enough about democracy that it is only as strong as its weakest candidate. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both, have weakened our democracy. Clinton and her campaign actively engaged in suppressing voters, like me, from being able to vote. Trump, by making statements like he may not accept the results of the election, threatens the very core of our most sacred American tradition - the peaceful transition of power from one president to another. It is our countries most vulnerable time.\n\nToday, I voted for Hillary Clinton. I did it because she is qualified for the presidency, and represents a great majority of the policies I want to see pushed forward in my lifetime. I voted for her acknowledging her weaknesses, and the corrupt and undemocratic processes her campaign engaged in. She is, undoubtedly, an imperfect candidate, but she maintains the level headed nature that is an essential trait of presidents. If she wins, I will be critical of her and her presidency, and hope that she follows through on some of the promises she has made. If she is unable to follow through should she be elected, I would back a potential primary challenger in 2020.\n\nVoting is your civic duty. But please, vote based off of policy and fact. Policy is what will change your future. And make you vote down ballot as well! Your senators, representatives, and local officials are just as essential to our democracy as the presidency, so get out there and do your duty!", "Yikes. That's midnight here.
