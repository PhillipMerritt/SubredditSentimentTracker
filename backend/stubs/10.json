So lawmakers eliminated these seven days of voting. \"After receipt of this racial data, the General Assembly amended the bill to eliminate the first week of early voting, shortening the total early voting period from seventeen to ten days,\" the court found.\n\n&gt;&gt; **Most strikingly, the judges point to a \"smoking gun\" in North Carolina's justification for the law, proving discriminatory intent. The state argued in court that \"counties with Sunday voting in 2014 were disproportionately black\" and \"disproportionately Democratic,\" and said it did away with Sunday voting as a result.**\n\n&gt;&gt; **\"Thus, in what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times, the State\u2019s very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race \u2014 specifically its concern that African Americans, who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, had too much access to the franchise,\" the judges write in their decision.**\n\nThey literally admitted to it.", "\"Just an election\" \n\nTell that to drug users in the Philippines.
