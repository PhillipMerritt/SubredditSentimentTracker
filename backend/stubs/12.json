Second of all guess this source must not be very reputable http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/washington/14arms.html?_r=0\n\nyou know...just the NYT. Oh wait but another bad one. Just the Middle East Research project. Another \"non-reputable\" source.\n\nhttp://www.merip.org/mer/mer246/washingtons-new-arms-bazaar\n\nso now youre 0/3 and so is Sirota. Want to delete your post and try again?\n\nEDIT: 0/4 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/30/AR2010013001477.html\n\nnow 0/5\n\nThe difference between these two ways of procuring arms from the US, and the associated pros/cons, are explained in these articles. One of the key differences is that unlike FMS, which is managed entirely by the US Government, DCS only requires an export license approval on a sale-by-sale basis and is not managed by the US Government. According to this GAO report:\nFor fiscal years 2008 through 2010, State reviewed 164,998 license applications worldwide and 28,550 for exports to the 13 transshipment countries (17 percent of all applications).[17] It approved 86 percent of license applications for these countries,[18] denied 1 percent, returned without action 13 percent, and suspended or revoked 1 percent of preexisting licenses.[19]\nLet's walk through some of the steps involved in obtaining a DCS license for a single export order:\nA business seeking to sell weapons via DCS has to first get a DCS designation from the Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d)\nThe business then needs to get a license from the Department of State (\"State\") for each individual export\nEach and every export license application gets scrutinized not just by State, but also by DoD and the Commerce Department [recall that State processed ~165,000 license applications in 2008-2010, say ~55,000 per year on average]\nDoD puts each application through a process by getting inputs from experts in all their agencies, starting with DTSA that manages the license process, to Army, Air Force, Navy - Joint Staff, Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics and Policy, in order to ensure there are no national security or defense related concerns\nDoD then weighs in with a recommendation to State on whether or not the application should be approved or denied\nAdditionally, for sales exceeding a threshold in the range of tens of $M, Congress MUST be notified as well\nIt is only after all those reviews, would State be able to make a final decision on the license [*Note that President Bush also issued a directive in Jan 2008 ordering the State Department to speed up the license approval process]\n\nIn contrast, if you read the IB Times article, you might be left with the impression that a Secretary of State, sitting in her office, perhaps issued a blanket cross-agency approval for billions of dollars in arms sales via DCS on a country-by-country basis, somehow overriding the detailed license-by-license, sale-by-sale, multi-agency, bureaucratic process involved in every individual sale. Not only was it utterly preposterous for the IB Times to include DCS arms data and tie it to Sec. Clinton, it is astounding that they showed zero interest in understanding or explaining how these arms deals get done and how impossible it would have been for a Secretary of State to issue some kind of secret, country-level, blanket approval for DCS deals.*\n\n*Most certainly, Hillary Clinton would have had no other mechanism to achieve this byzantine plot other than directing her secret cabal of gnomes to infiltrate the organization processing, say, 55,000 license applications a year and have them selectively issue more approvals for all licenses for arms exports to Clinton Foundation donors.\n\nso you didnt read the article and just saw the name and panicked then used a debunked chart based on the official government chart to try and prove it wasnt. Thats...embarrassing. Now scram.\n\nEDIT: oooh ooh I missed some. Perhaps this is a \"shady website\" (the official government document) http://pmddtc.state.gov/DTAG/documents/plenary_minutes_10_08.pdf\n\nall of these are the weapons deals \"clinton sold\" to saudi arabia. the problem is that it was bush and had nothing to do with Clinton except that she was SoS that continued them and actually slowed DOWN the sales.

I've met smart trump supporters they just prefer not to use their brains when it contradicts their feelings. They would rather believe something is true than look it up and verify that it is. \n\nThey're also more likely to complain about their status but unwilling to attend more schooling or trainings or even keep up with advancements in their field that would help to keep them competitive in the job market. \n\nFor example, coal is a dying industry that does more harm than good. Rather than accept government trainings aimed at replacing coal work with clean energy jobs, thus allowing coal workers to transition to the new job market, they fight tooth and nail to keep a dangerous, economically unviable and environmentally unsustainable industry in place. Best case scenario, they elect Trump and save their jobs for maybe another 5 years, at the expense of everyone else.  They could learn a new trade, they could take advantage of proposed programs that would help them with the transition and ensure them decades of future work. But instead they do their best to prevent progress. It's short sighted and lazy. \n\nThey feel entitled to jobs they haven't earned that require qualifications they refuse to get.  They complain about government handouts while begging the government to give them jobs without requiring them to train for them or learn anything new. Then they complain about minorities being lazy. \n\nIf you can't adapt and grow with society, you will be left behind. Trumpets are the ones who decided to eat dust rather than train themselves to keep up. \n\nTrumpets are lucky liberals care about those unable to care for themselves or they would be homeless already. As is the red states receive far more in welfare than they contribute to society. It's no secret the blue states are supporting red welfare states. Yet the red states complain they're not getting enough compared to the blue states. \n\nLazy, unambitious, entitled children. That's who support trump.

He was a supporter of the Iraq war before he was against it. He demanded intervention in Libya (before he decided it was a mistake), he has declared that he would destroy ISIS via the application of American troops (while simultaneously decrying whatever Obama and the rest of the world is doing as a mistake for reasons he can't actually articulate). He admits not paying taxes. He admits hiring contractors and small businesses to do jobs for him and then not paying them. He admits scamming students and residents of his properties. He has conclusively been shown to donate almost nothing at all to charity despite publicly stating he donates millions to basically everything - in particular, there is nothing at all to show that he gave anything to any 9-11 related charities despite claiming he did.\n\nMeanwhile, exactly what wars has Hillary Clinton started from her position as... someone who doesn't actually have the power to start wars?
