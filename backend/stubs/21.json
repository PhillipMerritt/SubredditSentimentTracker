In reality there are a lot of reasons different people voted for Trump (HRC was never well-liked by any demographic, gun control was unpopular, abortion and gay marriage are still benchmark issues for religious voters, etc.). To say that Trump was elected because people reject multiculturalism is an oversimplification.\n\nWhite Christian culture is in decline in the US, and ironically, a lot the same people who want Muslims to assimilate hold religious views that prevent them from assimilating into modern culture. They want to be able to deny marriage licenses to gay couples based on their religious beliefs, deny abortions to women based on their religious beliefs, etc. Denying Americans their Constitutional rights because of your religion is fundamentally wrong, even if you happen to be a Christian. This is not a Christian nation, this is a pluralistic society of human beings who are free to believe whatever they want. Christians see no problem with going against the grain culturally because of their religious views, but they see a problem when Muslims do it. The OP said, \"we will continue coming out to the voting booth and burning your entire globalist establishment to the fucking ground,\" and I'm sure the demographic he's referencing will continue to vote. However, that demographic is shrinking rapidly, and won't have much of a say in anything a decade or two from now.
