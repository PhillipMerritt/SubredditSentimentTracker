We only needed one day to discover what cabinet he had in mind, and what he really meant with his statements. \n\nBut more importantly, you american fellows need to understand what the roots of this faith are, and if you want to change it you have to act on the soil. Moore has a point.\nA large chunk of your voters are uneducated, frustrated, poor, intellectually weak people, exposed to any kind of populism. They don't have the tools to defend themselves.\nThey will *feel*, not *think*. They will *believe*. \n\nThis is the true weakness of a democracy. Democracy doesn't work well without freedom, and there's no freedom without education. Is an uninformed, ignorant choice, a true choice?\n\nWhen Hillary arrives at the debate dressed and groomed like a sci-fi intergalactic pope in white robes, those people will *feel* far from her, and won't *believe* her. Trump's message was so simple, so minimal, so empty, everyone's got it. Even the most simple mind. The media, baffled, has worked as an echo chamber, repeating his bullshit over and over until they became believable. He tricked the media. They did exactly what he wanted. Voices continuously repeating his name, monitors constantly showing his face. They mocked him, and he grew stronger. The more and more people went against him, the more his rhetoric \"I'm all alone against the establishment\" grew stronger. \n\nAnother element is that: it's been a very entertaining campaign. Entertaining like a trainwreck. It's awful, but you can't stop watching. I found myself following closely USA politics as I do with Italian politics, watching live all the debates. And I never did that. Just because of Trump. I expected entertainment, and I got it. \nCan you imagine how many americans did that too? How much attention he got for his attitude? \n\n*\"Finally someone who understands me! Someone who thinks and talks like me! Someone I can actually understand!  And he makes me laugh too! Because he says bad words in places where he shouldn't! SO FUN!\"*\n\nI may be exaggerating, but I think part of the votes were votes for the entertainment. Berlusconi held its power almost 2 decades playing with TV mechanics applied to politics. \n\nHowever I believe the main reason is that people wanted to say a big \"FUCK YOU!\" to all of those faces they are used to see around from decades, that they feel they betrayed and ignored them for a long time. And that FUCK YOU was incarnated by Trump. It doesn't matter if he had any believable solutions to their problem, that FUCK YOU felt very good. We can't know how long that feeling will last. \n\nThey felt Trump understood them. \nThat's the job of a salesman as Trump is. Take the form of your listener like a Ditto, mimic them to communicate and establish a bond with them. They will trust you and they will buy it, it doesn't matter what you're really selling to them, because they're buying... you. \n\nI've seen that in Italy with Berlusconi, I'm seeing it again now with Trump. \n\n(Apologies for my bad english.)\n", "\\&gt;posts long message in flawless English\n\n\\&gt;apologizes for English \n\nFucking Europeans I swear ", "Trump is playing peacemaker now.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing but it is a jarring change of rhetoric.", "On a side note I'd just like to say that we're the only first world country without universal healthcare and yet we still think it's our responsibility to be the world's policeman.", "&gt; When Hillary arrives at the debate dressed and groomed like a sci-fi intergalactic pope in white robes people will feel far from her,\n\nThis is the best sentence I've read in a while.", "An example of Stockholm syndrome if I ever saw one", "It's predictable.

Trump media will be 100X or 1,000X more useful as a literal propaganda arm of the state.

Steve Bannon is slated to be Trump's chief of staff. His real job might as well be media collaborator and propaganda czar. Think about this. The Trump administration does not have to take over media outlets to run their ongoing propaganda. Those outlets already exist. \n\nThere were already countless outlets ready and willing to churn out pro-Trump propaganda for the sake of monetizing ad clicks and traffic. How much more intense will their loyalty become when they are able to further monetize connections to the state via Trump Republican controlled Washington. \n\nAnd then there is Facebook, the most powerful vector for spreading demagogic propaganda in the history of the world. Republicans spent years cultivating their base to believe the traditional media cannot be trusted. They have created the ideal conditions for a walled garden.

And Facebook is the natural vector for delivering propaganda via socially created echo chamber, with the consumers of propaganda congratulating themselves for having the \"real\" story (as opposed to what the fake WaPo or fake NYT says on and on). \n\nOne of the big reveals of this election is how powerful propaganda is. And how easy demagoguery is. Trump demonstrated in real time how easy it is to lie constantly and nonstop with no consequence.

Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels' two terms.\n\nHe didn't do that. \n\nFrom day one, Pence didn't govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn't care about or didn't support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP's ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him.\n\nAs I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it's never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it's never been a state that follows the national GOP's social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I've been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office.\n\nSo Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana's image and its pocket book. \n\nIn the three years since Pence took office, he:\n\n* Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers\n\n* Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down\n\n* Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn't support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state\n\n* Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and \"fix it\" (this was actually the [front page](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/31/indy_star_fix_this_now_1427838279029_15914269_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) of the biggest newspaper in Indiana). \n\n* The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana's national image. He couldn't answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn't answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown. \n\n* During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to *other states* to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn't support.\n\n* He fought to pass a law preventing cities from passing their own minimum wage statutes. Is this \"small government\"? \n\n* He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey's Erdo\u011fan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent **and an elected official**, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google \"Mike Pence Glenda Ritz.\" You could write a thesis on it. \n\n* Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a *huge* federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can't be elected president--Pence's eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP's far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education's proposal to do just that. \n\n* The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage. \n\n* Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it's probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement. \n\n* He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don't even know if that's legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party. \n\n* He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn't back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional.\n\n* He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama's evil despotic EPA. \n\nThis is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he's the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan *Pence Must Go* campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally [billboards](http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/original/3821872/pmg_billboard.jpg) and [yard signs](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/04/17/16x9/_Fire_Pence__signs_go_up_after_RFRA_2839710000_16967639_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state's reputation and economy. \n\nEdit - From /u/masamunecyrus.

Here's a short part from each point: \n\n1. Rule #1: **Believe the autocrat. He means what he says.** Whenever you find yourself thinking or hear others claiming, that he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a rationalization. This will happen often: humans seem to have evolved to practice denial when confronted publicly with the unacceptable. \n\n1. Rule #2: **Do not be taken in by small signs of normality.** Consider the financial markets this week, which, having tanked overnight, rebounded following the Clinton and Obama speeches. Confronted with political volatility, the markets become suckers for calming rhetoric from authority figures. So do people. Panic can be neutralized by falsely reassuring words about how the world as we know it has not ended. \n\n1. Rule #3: **Institutions will not save you.** It took Putin a year to take over the Russian media and four years to dismantle its electoral system; the judiciary collapsed unnoticed. The capture of institutions in Turkey has been carried out even faster, by a man once celebrated as the democrat to lead Turkey into the EU. Poland has in less than a year undone half of a quarter century\u2019s accomplishments in building a constitutional democracy.\n\n1. Rule #4: **Be outraged.** If you follow Rule #1 and believe what the autocrat-elect is saying, you will not be surprised. But in the face of the impulse to normalize, it is essential to maintain one\u2019s capacity for shock. This will lead people to call you unreasonable and hysterical, and to accuse you of overreacting. It is no fun to be the only hysterical person in the room. Prepare yourself.\n\n1. Rule #5: **Don\u2019t make compromises**. Like Ted Cruz, who made the journey from calling Trump \u201cutterly amoral\u201d and a \u201cpathological liar\u201d to endorsing him in late September to praising his win as an \u201camazing victory for the American worker,\u201d Republican politicians have fallen into line. Conservative pundits who broke ranks during the campaign will return to the fold. Democrats in Congress will begin to make the case for cooperation, for the sake of getting anything done\u2014or at least, they will say, minimizing the damage. \n\n1. Rule #6: **Remember the future. Nothing lasts forever**. Donald Trump certainly will not, and Trumpism, to the extent that it is centered on Trump\u2019s persona, will not either. Failure to imagine the future may have lost the Democrats this election. They offered no vision of the future to counterbalance Trump\u2019s all-too-familiar white-populist vision of an imaginary past. \n", "&gt;he has offered few details other than tactics like \"bomb the shit out of 'em\" \"take the oil,\" and \"take out their families,\" the majority of which are considered war crimes under international law.\n\nI shouldn't be laughing, but this is just so ridiculous.", "Also that she saw it as a complete inevitability.", "He's going to propose single payer and breaking up the big banks next.", "&gt; He worked some as a carpenter although \u201che was a shitty carpenter,\u201d Bloch told me. \u201cHis carpentry,\u201d Morrisseau said, \u201cwas not going to support him, and didn\u2019t.\u201d", "This last cycle just might convince him.
