Obama retains some popularity amongst workers for fighting for the auto-industry the bailout helping to keep their jobs around, etc.  Fairly or unfairly, Clinton was painted as the pro-corporate anti-worker candidate, and so Trump inherited that vote.  With that seemingly representing the divide in the electorate, it makes a(n extremely) perverse sort of sense when they go from Obama to Trump in one leap.

It was about her thirst for power. Anyone could have seen this when the Clintons left D.C. in 2001. Even though she was from Illinois and they had been together in Arkansas before, they went to NY where there was an open Senate seat waiting for her. If that seat had been in Hawaii, they would have moved there.\n\nSo she gets the Senate seat so she can built up her street cred for a future run for the White House herself. But suddenly in 2007 this upstart Senator from Illinois who, let's be honest, has nothing but eloquence as his initial qualification, upstages her. He has a goofy, foreign-sounding name, woefully little experience in politics and in D.C., and he's a nobody challenging perhaps the most powerful political name besides the Kennedy's.\n\nShe loses to him, but not before making a deal that she would be his Secretary of State, should he win, so she can build up more street cred and make a big push in 2016. She serves as SoS for his first term, resigns, and then starts putting everything in place for her big moment in 2016.\n\nWhen the head of the DNC has to leave, she likely makes a deal that her agent will be the new head of the DNC, and the former head can be her running mate. The new head of the DNC gets to work laying out the red carpet for Hillary's big push.\n\nBut then, again, out of nowhere, this upstart guy from Vermont steps forward and starts to run a campaign against her. He's an outsider and an anti-establishment candidate. He starts to gain ground. So Hillary and the DNC people she controls start pulling levers to destroy his chances and put everything in her favor.\n\nShe wins the primary, but not before developing bitter resentment over anyone who would oppose her, calling his supporters, \"fucking dumbshits\" and when asked if she would alter any part of her platform for reconciliation among the Democratic party, she responds, \"Why would I? I'm winning!\"\n\nIt would seem easy for her and the Dems to ignore the support and the movement from Bernie if it hadn't been for the fact that the *exact* same thing was happening with the Republicans. Trump was more of an outsider and anti-establishment candidate than Bernie. He destroyed Jeb Bush's career; railroaded Cruz; trounced Rubio; stiffarmed Christie. \n\nHow Clinton and her team could miss the signs indicating that anti-establishment fervor was sweeping the nation is beyond me. How the DNC could think that then putting the biggest establishment candidate they had into the fray was a good idea is mind-boggling. But then again, when Clinton controls the DNC, it's easy to see how they might miss it or at least shut their eyes to that possibility.\n\nBut Clinton's arrogance didn't end there. When it became clear that she wasn't really a popular candidate, she had the idiocy to blurt out, even if it was off-the-cuff, \"How am I not ahead by 50 points?!\" She truly just didn't get it.\n\nIf you can't win against someone who insulted and demeaned a genuine war hero in John McCain; someone who insulted and belittled the family of another fallen soldier; someone who insulting his way through the primaries and then the general election; maybe you should take a look at what *you're* doing wrong.\n\nHer response was just to air commercials and videos of Trump being stupid. That is **not** how you win elections; by giving people a reason not to vote for someone. You win elections by giving people a reason to vote *for* you. \n\nWhen Clinton had the chance to deal with policy and promote plans and goals, she didn't. Presumably she didn't think she had to touch any of that when some nut was the opponent.\n\nEven when her buddies and NBC \"suddenly\" found this tape of Trump bragging about his way with women, she couldn't do anything with it. (And I say \"suddenly\" because, let's be honest, when Trump became the candidate every single station on the planet sent people into their own archives to dig up every tape and second of footage of Trump and Clinton they had to see what was there. So if you think this incredibly embarrassing tape was just suddenly found at that opportune moment, then you're about as naive as they come. NBC had that tape for months and help on to it until they wanted to use it.)\n\nIn short, Clinton became so wrapped up in the idea that it was \"her turn\" and that she didn't really need to try to run a campaign against that nutty Trump fella that it cost her. She funneled money from Congressional campaigns into her own coffers and cost the Democrats seats in those races. She essentially demanded that the entire machinery of the Democratic party stop to support her quest for the White House at all costs. In doing so, *she* cost the country a balanced Congress and resident on Pennsylvania Ave. that is potentially dangerously unqualified to live there.", "I have friends who don't believe me when I say that Bill was impeached.", "Exactly.
