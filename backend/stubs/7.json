The emergence of the religious right in the shadow of the post-Civil Rights Democratic party. The hard split in partisanship really took off during the beginning and tail end of the Bush Sr era. The '88 the Republicans fought dirty claiming Dukakis had a mental disorder, the prison furlough program (Willie Horton), he's going to take their guns, and so on. Dukakis tried the \"we go high thing\" rather than pointing out Reagan was obviously suffering from dementia (fairly well-known in the DC crowd), or pointing out Reagan, as governor of California had been the first to employ the prison furloughs, signed gun control measures in CA and had proposed Gun Free School zones (passed in 1990). We know how '88 turned out.\n\nWell, budget season didn't go well for George Sr, especially with military spending continuing to grow after the fall of the USSR. To mollify the Democrats in Congress, Bush allowed some specific revenue increases that were sorta \"new taxes\" to get a solid budget through. \n\nIn 1992, the gloves came off. Despite Atwater's death, they employed a similar model of attacking Clinton's role as governor... problem was, Clinton had been fairly moderate thanks to the political climate in Arkansas. Bush found himself walking a fine line in attacking Clinton''s record, without bruising his own. Coupled with a flank attack from a feisty Perot, Bush found himself taking heat from Perot for the \"new taxes\", countering his famous \"read my lips\" speech... then Clinton ran ads doing the same thing. Then Grover Norquist (up and coming asshole, still little known) called Bush out in an op-ed for it, too! Bush made the mistake of reaching across the aisle, and he was getting heat from all sides. Deserved, if you consider his '88 campaign, but it was a very bad thing for our country.\n\nWith 1994, we saw Gingrich and his Contract on America, later the Ken Starr investigation, then impeachment, then the Hastert rule, the growth of punditry in the 24 hour news cycle, Rush and Fox... \n\nTo Republicans, George HW Bush was a cautionary tale, warning them against the perils of bipartisanship, and they took that lesson to heart. Democrats had no idea what they inadvertently started until they had to call on their senate majority to keep an obviously bull shit attempt to oust the president at bay. And they could only watch in horror as the weaponry of the lunatic religious right was deployed in the 2000 Republican primary against McCain, who had been a very well known figure due to his ability to work with them. \n\nI don't know if this is the culmination and/or the end result, but God I hope so.", "&gt; As a sane Republican\n\nYou'll be labeled as a RINO.

First and foremost it's been truly disheartening to see the incredible amount of hatred, prejudice, and ignorance coming from Trump supporters. The primaries were also incredibly disappointing with regards to the Democratic party (and the DNC in particular). I voted Clinton in the generals, but her fans' constantly making excuses for her and condescending dismissal of valid complaints and concerns from other liberals left a bad taste in my mouth. You all seriously need to be careful how you move forward in reaching out to Democrats who are on the fence with Clinton - she's not going to be so lucky as to face someone as stupid as Trump later on, and you'll need all the help you can get. \n\nParticipation in midterm elections will be essential to make sure leftist policies can progress, but there are certain areas within the president's sphere (particularly with regards to foreign policy) that may very well lead people to cast off even the meagre support they gave Clinton this time. If she loses in 2020 because of something like that, it's her own fault - at some point the elected officials need to be held accountable for their performances instead of lazily relying on fear of the opposition party doing the work for them.

As a separate point a lot of Bernie's weaknesses couldn't be exploited by Clinton in the primary, in the same way that a lot of Trump's weaknesses couldn't be exploited by Republican primary opponents.  Calling Bernie a socialist was clearly fine with Democratic primary voters, for example, but could easily have been weaponized against him in a general election with a broader electoral base.

The GOP would be equally monstrous regardless of what the Democratic candidate for president was, it's just that a black man allows the racists to shine, and a woman brings the misogynists to the forefront.\n\nIn my opinion, it's a few factors at play. Firstly, Fox News, conservative talk radio, and websites like Breitbart provide an echo chamber so conservatives can go the entire news day only hearing one side of any issue. And second, with gerrymandering making a lot of voting districts safe red districts, Republicans in those districts have no reason to moderate to appease democrat and centrist voters, and on the contrary have every reason to pander as far to the right as they can to ensure that they aren't pushed out by a more extreme primary challenger.\n\nAt that point, the entire party turns into a competition to see who can hate liberals the most, cooperate the least, and propose the most \"conservative\" policies, regardless of what the American populace as a whole wants.
