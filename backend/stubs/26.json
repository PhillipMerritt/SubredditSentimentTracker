None of this is steeped in fact - it'd be just as simple to say any other politician ever *could* do the same. It's a totally pointless anecdote that drives home your predisposed bias towards a singular candidate. Who says we needed Trump to do what you say could be done? Who says Obama wasn't already doing that? People are not very split on climate change - I think you're digesting the wrong media outlet. \n\n&gt;As for the climate scientists like myself that recognize the potentially dire issues here, there needs to be some coherent realistic plan as well.\n\nYou're a climate scientist who was totally unaware of Obama's MATS, Green Power Plan, and the Paris Promise? \n\n&gt;You may not realize it but many scientists have long ago abandoned the idea that humanity will make significant changes. Only two small nations kept their Kyoto commitment. Germany for one example has massive immigration-related unrest and the German coal miners will likely reverse the German coal reduction commitment.\nWere we on a track** to prevent climate change with President Obama? Nope.** Might we under President Trump? Maybe.\n\nThis is how I know you're waist-high in willful ignorance and the claim that you - yourself - are a climate scientist is outrageous; *everyone already KNOWS climate change cannot be prevented - it's already fucking occurring.*\n\nBeyond that - what do other nation's commitments, or lack thereof, have to do with America doing what's objectively correct? \n\n&gt;I have made no claim that \"is false and plain rhetoric\". I don't know what our new President will do. Only you made this claim.\n\nSince it obviously isn't clear, this is what rhetoric looks like:\n\n&gt;Might we under President Trump? Maybe.\n\n&gt;**He is going to tear up all of the worthless treaties, so don't wail and gnash your teeth then.** Wait for the next phase. **Stand and help unite our nation to make progress**, to create binding treaties on Climate Change.\n\n&gt;**Trump may unify America behind climate change**. He also might not. **Obama actually reduced public support by making it a progressive's only issue**, so can Trump do better?\n\nWhat you seem to confused on is that we were already doing all of these things. The idea that you, and whoever you consider your constituents to be, are against some party of \"progressives\" is so outrageously inane it's hard to even find a starting point - I guess I'm supposed to ask: \"what's wrong with wanting progress?\"\n\n&gt;Trump is a very smart president who will have a very smart and informed climate change staff. I presume that while his approach will likely be different, that it will be both smart and informed.\n\nPresume is where you've finally nailed it. Instead of objectively looking at evidence, you continue to try and force feed this narrative (and still don't know where the rhetoric is?). Let's tackle this objectively:\n\n1) Why do you believe Trump is a smart president? What has lead you to that belief, beyond someone else simply telling you that's the case?\n\n2) Trump has appointed a renowned climate-denier has head of the EPA. This is an objective fact - what you're suggesting has already come to pass and he's chosen a willfully ignorant politician whose largest contributor are the Koch's. Are you interested in changing this claim, or do you still believe the head of the EPA need not believe *climate change is a real thing* in order to make progress on climate change?\n\n&gt;As a climate scientist I have looked for a plan that might reverse the warming process and I have not found one. You presume that we can do this. Why?\n\nYou aren't a climate scientist. No climate scientist would ever even form this sentence *because it is flat common knowledge* that there is no path to totally reversing what's *already set in motion.* This has effectively been common knowledge for nearly a decade and nowhere in our thread have I \"presumed\" there to be such a \"cure.\" In fact, many times over I've pushed for maintaining a *slowing down climate change* because there *is no cure* - while you've continued to insist there is some other option than slowing the acceleration of climate change. In case you've forgot:\n\n&gt;Remember that none of the plans and agreements would have stopped climate change, at best they would slow the rate of acceleration.\n\n&gt;So the key question is if Clinton's election would have resolved anything important other than slowing the rate of acceleration?\n\nIt's absurd to form this argument - because climate scientists *already know* there is no other current solution than slowing the rate of acceleration. There's no time to sit around and wait for a miraculous cure-all to be invented. Further, there's no reason to believe we cannot do BOTH as we move forward to tackle this imminent global catastrophe. \n\n&gt;If there are \"deniers\" then their also must be \"believers\".\n\nThis is purely the logical fallacy of false dichotomy. Your claim here is flatly false - those are NOT the only two options. \n\n&gt;You are a believer? Fine, I respect this. \n\nYou've extrapolated something bordering the insane; nowhere have I suggested any of my claims are steeped in some 'belief' system. One does not *believe* that evidence exists. \n\n&gt;President Trump may not be a \"believer\" in your religious catechism but he likely will take some significant actions based upon the science.\n\nAgain, this is wholly derived from your first logical fallacy that there's this dichotomy at all. Further, again, this is purely rhetoric - the facts we have are what Trump has put down on paper in his 100-day plan and his appointment of a known climate denier; that he will bolster fossil fuels to boost working class economy, reverse 30b in renewable spending. None of which are actions based upon the science - so again, your position here is purely a narrative you wish to convey. What you're saying is the opposite of what is happening in reality. The idea that you'd attempt to portray my stance as a religious 'belief' is break-neck asinine. \n\n*You* can continue to *believe* Trump will essentially do the opposite of what he's promised. *I'll* continue to look at the evidence and pass on fact-based claims - as a \"scientist\" surely you're familiar with the practice.

There was a ballot measure in Colorado (a fairly young, liberal state mind you) that literally allowed people to vote whether they wanted a universal health care system like the one for which Bernie advocates. It lost 79-21. *California* rejected a death penalty ban. The country just is not ripe for a left-wing movement, as much as r/politics would like it to be.\n\nBernie had good favorability ratings, sure, but those were before literally any attacks on him. Hillary took a huge early delegate lead and didn't want to alienate too far Bernie or his supporters. Republicans wanted to compliment Bernie so he'd be a bigger challenge to Hillary and create a fractured left. No one had a reason to attack Bernie. \n\nOnce he got the nomination all hell would've broken loose. His Soviet flag his mayor's office. His honeymoon in the Soviet Union. His consistent praise of the Castros (which would've played *real* well with Cubans in the swing state of Florida, I'm sure.) His visits with left-wing dictators in South America. Subtle attacks on his lack of (at bare minimum, Christian) faith. Republicans have long sought to blur the line between democratic socialism and communism. Bernie would do a lot of that for them. They would've united better against him than even Hillary Clinton.\n\nNever forget that the Internet is not real life. The two types of people Americans say they would least likely elect President are athiests and socialists ([source](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx)) Bernie openly admits he's one and is pretty easily characterized as the other. \n\nBernie is a nice guy, but he's  pretty easily caricatured. Republicans would've driven him into the ground immediately. Moderates (many of whom did break for Hillary, by the way) would've been very skittish to vote for a guy openly advocating for a revolution. Plus Trump's overwhelmingly personality honestly could've overpowered Bernie in debates. Remember: Hillary beat Trump in all three debates and still lost. Could Bernie have done the same? I doubt it.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern with Bernie would be turning out black voters. Even Hillary Clinton, the wife of \"the first black President\" couldn't get the African American turnout Obama did. Bernie got absolutely slaughtered in the primaries among African Americans. That's indisputable, and I don't think blaming the DNC can explain that one away. How does he get them to turnout? Maybe he could make better inroads with rural whites in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (which I would question, considering their likely aversion to a socialist candidate), but those gains would be wiped out and then some by lower African American turnout in Detroit, the Twin Cities, and Philadelphia. If a Democrat doesn't turn out African Americans, they lose. I think that would be a major major struggle for Sanders.\n\nEdit: Taxes would be a huge problem for Sanders, especially given his background as a career politician. Imagine the speeches from Trump: \"Crazy Bernie [an epithet that would slowly morph into Commie Bernie, I'm sure] wants to hike taxes for everyone! Maybe if he had ever had a real job instead of spending 30 years doing nothing in Washington, he'd understand why the AMERICAN PEOPLE can't handle MORE taxes.\"\n\nI'll add more as I think of them, this is off the top of my head.\n\nEdit (Again, I've fixed a lot of grammar and whatnot): Lots of people saying \"well my friends loved Bernie but didn't like Hillary.\" I get that, but those are the people who could very well be persuaded against Bernie with time. People's opinion of politicians really do change; they're not static. I live in Indiana and Evan Bayh went from a literal 20 point lead with great favorability ratings to a 10 point loss with negative favorability in like 4 months.
