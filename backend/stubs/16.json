Clearly most of what is contained in this memo is work the DNC is  already doing. This exercise is intended to put those ideas to paper.\n\n&gt; **Our Goals &amp; Strategy**\n\n&gt; Our hope is that the goal of a potential HRC campaign and the DNC would be one-in-the-same: to make whomever the  Republicans nominate unpalatable to a majority of the electorate.  We have outlined three strategies to obtain our goal:  \n\n&gt; 1) Force all Republican candidates to lock themselves into extreme conservative positions that will hurt them in a  general election;\n\n&gt; 2) Undermine any credibility/trust Republican presidential candidates have to make inroads to our coalition or  independents;\n\n&gt; 3) Muddy the waters on any potential attack lodged against HRC.\n\n\n&gt; **Operationalizing the Strategy**\n\n&gt; *Pied Piper Candidates*\n\n\n&gt; There are two ways to approach the strategies mentioned above. The first is to use the field as a whole to inflict damage  on itself similar to what happened to Mitt Romney in 2012. The variety of candidates is a positive here, and many of the  lesser known can serve as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right. In this scenario, we  don\u2019t want to marginalize the more extreme candidates, but make them more \u201cPied Piper\u201d candidates who actually  represent the mainstream of the Republican Party. Pied Piper candidates include, but aren\u2019t limited to:\n\n&gt; \u2022 Ted Cruz\n\n&gt; \u2022 Donald Trump\n\n&gt; \u2022 Ben Carson\n\n\n&gt; We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to them  seriously. \n\n&gt; *Undermining Their Message &amp; Credibility*\n\n&gt; Most of the more-established candidates will want to focus on building a winning general election coalition. The \u201cPied  Pipers\u201d of the field will mitigate this to a degree, but more will need to be done on certain candidates to undermine  their credibility among our coalition (communities of color, millennials, women) and independent voters. In this regard,  the goal here would be to show that they are just the same as every other GOP candidate: extremely conservative on  these issues.\n", "HRC would have been on the right side in europe.
