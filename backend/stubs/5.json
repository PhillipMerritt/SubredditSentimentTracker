What on earth do you possibly do at that moment *that isn't going to be considered partisan*?  \nAdd to that, the fact that Comey probably knew full well that there were firebrand agents at the NY field office with ties to Guliani and an axe to grind.

And let's be honest Donald Trump has no loyalty to the GOP or conservative values or even basic decency. I doubt there is much inner turmoil amongst Republicans who cannot vote for Trump. It's clear to everyone with the ability to think critically that Trump is an amoral ignoramus with the temperament of a chihuahua. ", "To me the crazy part of this isn't that the Trump is campaign lying so blatantly here -- they've proven themselves to be inveterate, remorseless, unrepentant liars over the last year or so, which just makes this ad par for the course. \n\nThe crazy thing to me is that in the context of all these totally manipulated and fabricated statements, rebuttals and advertisements, all this indisputable lying, Trump's followers aren't just supporting him, they're *fervently* supporting him, like a religious figure. \n\nIf this doesn't throw up a million red flags for you about how dangerous Trump is nothing ever will, but allow me to spell this out: Trump's constituents are de facto cult members, and he is playing each and every one of them in precisely the same way as a cult leader would. Please remember this fact if you're considering voting for Trump, and please realize the devastating effect this would have on our country if he were to win. ", "I think he just repeats whatever people tell him. ", "Most of the time you don't need to read the article on Reddit until the comments tell you it's worth it or not", "I thought he misspoke meant to say thousand instead of million. No. He literally says it would triple our population in one week. What a moron.", "I want to believe so bad...", "To be fair there are a shit load of Catholics who so not like the current Pope because he, incidentally, espouses the words of Jesus and he lives his life based on compassion and empathy. Many of them prefer the fire and brimstone God, not the loving New Testament God. Which begs the question, why are they Catholics at all, then, but that's another story.\n\nI grew up Catholic and abandoned that as soon as I could. But much of my family and extended relations are either Irish or Roman Catholic to a tee, and they don't like this modern Pope. I love him. I'm not religious at all, but I read his newest book and really think he's got an important message for those who live their lives in faith. It's a shame that so many people would rather hate than love, even when their faith tells them not to.", "Florida"], "links": ["5bf6ti", "5bf6ti", "5bfdnl", "5bf6ti", "5bebz1", "5bf6ti", "5bf6ti",
