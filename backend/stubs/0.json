I'm not an expert, but am an amateur radio guy and know a little bit about it.\n\nFor one, *everyone* carries a radio transceiver today.  A cell phone is not a phone at all, it's a radio transceiver.  So are Wi-Fi stations, some remote controls, appliances, a thousand different things use radio frequencies today.  Further, radio frequencies bounce around and get in through tiny cracks.  Keeping radio frequencies out is like waterproofing when the water is invisible.  It's difficult to keep radio frequencies out short of a Faraday cage.\n\nSo, yes, is it very possible that the detected radio frequencies were coming from outside the building or some random appliance inside.  That is not to say there was no bug.  It is also possible that there is/was a bug.  It would not surprise me.  But you absolutely cannot conclude there was a bug without actually finding the bug.\n\nFurther, small bugs that transmit radio frequencies have been around since the transistor was developed back in the late 1950s.  So these devices have been around for about 60 years.\n\nThey are little microphones that pick up sound and broadcast it to someone listening outside the building.  You've probably seen someone sweep for bugs in the movies and on TV.  The device they use is a radio frequency detector.  It picks up radio frequencies and can tell you the strength of the frequency, so you can find the bug.\n\nWhich makes this story odd because they should have been able to triangulate the frequency they found.  This is super common stuff, everyone.  Look up \"fox hunts\" for amateur radio enthusiasts.  The \"fox\" is a small radio transmitter hidden somewhere.  The hunters use detection devices - often homemade - to find the \"fox.\"  You compete on how quickly you can find it.\n\nA couple more notes:\n\n1. Much more sophisticated, and harder to detect, bugs can be built by electronics hobbyists.  All the parts are commonly available through Digikey or Mouser.  You can easily find plans to build these on the Internet.  Something that won't give itself away so easily can be built in an hour or two, inexpensively.\n\n2. A few years back I ran into a guy who claimed to be retired NSA at a hamfest.  I have no idea if he actually was.  But I had an extremely interesting conversation with him.  He said he had spent his career on the hardware side in the NSA, building and deploying electronics.  This guy knew his shit.  He really, really knew his shit.  He had a ridiculous knowledge of all the civilian/public radio stuff in the area and I learned a lot - all of it true and accurate.  He didn't reveal anything classified, but told me that the devices he worked on were several orders of magnitude more sophisticated than what hobbyists build.  I don't have any trouble believing that.  Considering that hobbyists can build difficult to detect bugs, the pro stuff is probably impossible to find.\n\nWhile I don't have any evidence to go on here, finding some stray radio frequencies without finding a bug is most likely a false alarm.", "I think these early voting numbers is showing that the electorate really isn't as fickle as the variation in polls leads one to believe.
